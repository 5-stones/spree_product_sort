Spree Product Sort
==================

Simple extention to sort products within a taxon.

It works by creating a new DB table to store the product positions for each taxon, and adding an admin view that lets you drag-and-drop them into place.

A product decorator is added which only will show products with a direct relation to a taxon (not the descendents).
